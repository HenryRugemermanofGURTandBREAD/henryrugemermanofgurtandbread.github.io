    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>The black box does not contain the main tube that acts as a reservoir with smaller tubes coming out of it. 

</p>
    <h1> Evidence </h1>
    <p> The mystery black box is a box that you pour water into at the top and then some unknown process happens and a different amount of water comes out of the bottom. Our initial observations were that the amount of water that you put in and the water that comes out varies so there must be a place where the water is stored like a reservoir. When we tested the original box we found out that every time we put water in a smaller amount would come out until the fifth trial when a lot more came out. Our approach to figuring out what was inside this box was to build and test a box of our own to see if the data matched with the original box. Our model had the main tube that acted as a reservoir with smaller tubes scattered around the main tube allowing the water to exit from two different areas. We tested our model by pouring in the same amount of water for five trials and a smaller amount came out of each team but we never had that fifth trial where a lot more came out. When we put 100 ml in, about 85 ml would come out but it stayed constant for all five trials so we knew that this model was not what was inside the original box. </p>
    <h1> Reasoning Part 1 </h1> 
    <p> A model is another word for a prototype or a smaller version of the actual product. Models can be useful for testing to see if the product is successful and is a lot easier to present because it is smaller. The strengths of a model is that it is easier to make, test and adjust if needed. The limitations are that it is missing some details from the product because it is a much simpler version. </p>
    <h1> Reasoning Part 2 </h1> 
    <p> The model that we made is not what is actually in the real box because the data did not match up after we tested so therefore our theory was wrong. </p>
    <h1> Reasoning Part 3 </h1> 
    <p> If our theory was right on the fifth trial a lot more water would come out of our model therefore matching the data of the original black box. However, this did not happen so out theory was disproven. </p>
